#################

virtualenvwrapper is a set of extensions to Ian Bicking's `virtualenv
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ tool.  The extensions include
wrappers for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise
managing your development workflow, making it easier to work on more
than one project at a time without introducing conflicts in their
dependencies.

========
Features
========

1.  Organizes all of your virtual environments in one place.

2.  Wrappers for creating and deleting environments, including
    user-configurable hooks.

3.  Use a single command to switch between environments.

4.  Tab completion for commands that take a virtual environment as
    argument.

Rich Leland has created a short `screencast
<http://mathematism.com/2009/jul/30/presentation-pip-and-virtualenv/>`__
showing off the features of virtualenvwrapper.

===========
Quick Setup
===========

1. Create a directory to hold all of the virtual environments. The default is
   ``$HOME/.virtualenvs``.

2. Add two lines to your .bashrc to set the location where the virtual environments should
   live and the location of the script installed with this package::

    export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
    source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper_bashrc

3. Run: ``source ~/.bashrc``
4. Run: ``workon``
5. A list of environments, empty, is printed.
6. Run: ``mkvirtualenv temp``
7. A new environment, ``temp`` is created and activated.
8. Run: ``workon``
9. This time, the ``temp`` environment is included.
